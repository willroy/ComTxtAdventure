Get Equip and Unequip to work
Also get examine to work
also get battle to fully work (like using heal potions)
Work on a menu like so:

    Inventory (1)
    Character (2)
    Options   (3)
    Back      (4)
    Exit      (5)
  
    => 

then work on random encounters rather then set destinations of enemies.
maybe an option to turn of random encounters (in options) oh and maybe put
debug commands in there too why not.
